    <h2><center>Papa Luigi's Pizzeria!<center></h2>
   
    <h3><center>We created a game that lets you personalize your pizza by choosing from a variety of pizza toppings and even deciding the amounts for each topping. The toppings are then randomly placed on the pizza.</h3>

    <h2><center>Blue Ball for College!<center></h2>

    <h3><center>Our game is based on a bowling game where the player can move the blue bowling ball left and right using keys and press the space bar to bowl the ball. Each pin in the game stands for a college and the user gets into the college of the respective pin they knock. </h3>

    <h2><center>Space Invaders!<center></h2>
    
    <h3><center>The goal of our game is to shoot down the aliens that are trying to invade our world. You can move the character using the left and right keys and then using your mouse to aim, you can press the top arrow key to shoot lasers at the aliens. You have three lives in case an alien hits your character and at the end, depending on your score, you will be awarded a medal. </h3>

    <h2><center>Analyzing Honey Production<center></h2>
    <br>
    <h3><center>   The goal of this analysis is to understand the trends in honey production by each state. Using data from USDA, we graphed the data in different forms to see different trends in the data.</h3>

    <h2><center>Bug Hunt and Invasive Species Simulation<center></h2>
    <br>
    <h3><center> This model simulates the potnetial effects of invasive species on native species and their predators. The model shows how adding invasive species increase compeition for grass which in turn reduces the native bug population. This model can also simulate situations where massive amounts of grass may die off or a mass amount of bugs may dissapear.</h3>

	    <h2><center>Rover Data Analysis<center></h2>
		    <br>
    <h3><center>  The goal of this project was to use data about rovers collected by different sesnors and determine what each section of the data stands for. Using that inofrmation, you had to determine where the the rover was located by matching the graphs to the regional descriptions. After analyzing the graphs, I determined that Inland Forests would be the closest match to the graphs.</h3>
